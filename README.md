Languages Used
This repository primarily contains solutions in:

Python - Most solutions are implemented in Python for simplicity and readability.
JavaScript - A few solutions are available in JavaScript, especially for problems suited to web-based applications.
Java - Solutions to select problems implemented in Java.
Feel free to reach out if you'd like solutions in other languages!

Solution Structure
Each solution file follows this format:

Problem Description: Brief summary of the problem to provide context.
Approach: Outline of the approach, including reasoning and key observations.
Complexity Analysis: Time and space complexity for the solution.
Code: The actual code for the solution.
Test Cases: Sample test cases with expected outputs.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Problem: Two Sum
# Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
# 
# Approach:
# - Use a hash map to store the complement of each element.
# - Check if the complement exists in the hash map to identify the pair.
#
# Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        complement_map = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in complement_map:
                return [complement_map[complement], i]
            complement_map[num] = i
